            <p class="p1">Hello my name is Jesse Wales. I go to Freyberg High School in Palmerston North. My hobbies include watching YouTube, watching UFC and playing games on Xbox and Computer.<br><br>On YouTube I watch a large variety of videos which range from gaming videos to sports montages. What I enjoy about YouTube is you will always find something you will enjoy as there is such a large volume of different videos.<br><br>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is the worlds leading mixed martial arts (MMA) organisation. MMA is the sport which includes all the martial arts together, such as Boxing, Wrestling or Jiu-Jitsu. The UFC holds a few events a month with one of them being Pay Per View (PPV). As you can imagine with such a high number of events they would need a huge roster to fill in the fight cards. There are 500 plus contracted UFC fighters. Some notable ones are Ronda Rousey, Conor McGregor and Mark Hunt who is from New Zealand.<br><br>Games, everyone enjoys playing some type of games whether they be real or not. The type of games that I like to play are on Computer and Xbox. On computer I play only a couple of games with one being Civilization V. This game is a bit old but I think it is still one of the best games made. In this game you start with barely anything and then as you progress you build your Civilization to then take over the world. On Xbox I play Call Of Duty Black Ops 1 & 2. These games are old as well but have recently become backwards compatiable for the Xbox One (they were previously on the Xbox 360 which is the older console). In these games it is straight forward, you attack as many enemies as you can and try to survive without being attacked yourself. They are both War based games. </p>
