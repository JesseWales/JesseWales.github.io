            <p class="p1">I do not have many skills but there are some. These skills include being able to effectively mow the lawns, hang the washing out and do the dishes.<br><br>Mowing the lawns seems to be very straight forward but if you think about it deeply you can fully understand what it is. Some people like to do their lawns in an inwards spiral pattern whilst other may like to do a straight lined pattern. I myself like to use the inwards spiral pattern as it seems to make the job more enjoyable. That is just domestic lawns though, there are rugby fields, soccer pitch and the most advanced type of grass cutting is found on the cricket grounds. All of these different grass types inspire me to view mowing domestic lawns differently.<br><br>Another overlooked skill in society is the ability to hang the washingoutside on the washing line. If not done correctly you may find yourself at the end of the day getting your washing in and it being damp. There are many reasons why this could occur. Firstly misjudging the weather. Rain and clothes do not get along, if you hang your washing out and it starts raing you clothes will just get wet again so that was just wasted time. If you judge the weather correctly you eill be able to put your washing on A-Frames and hang it undercover, which I do often in this city. Of course you avoid all this hassle by just putting your wet washing in the dryer but what fun is that also our clothes need fresh air like us.<br><br>Dishes. Everyone has their own special way of dealing with the worst part about meals so I am just going to say how I do them and why. There are two different scenarios I encounter with cleaning dishes, the difference is whether I have a dishwasher or not. Most of the time I have access to a dishwasher so I will talk about that. Firstly I scrape the plates to remove any large chunks of food off the plate so the sink doesnt get too dirty. Once that is done I warm up the tap and leave it running whilst I rinse off any noticable grime on the plates afte that they go directly into the dishwasher and cleaned more thoroughly. After that the dishwasher is emptied and this cycle is repeated every dishes time. </p>
